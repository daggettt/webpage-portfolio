        <h1>A little bit about me...</h1>
        <p>Like many folks during the summer of 2020, I found myself in need of a new hobby. With an unprecedented amount of free time - <i>and existential dread</i> - 
            I decided to dabble with web design. This eventually led me down a Reddit rabbit hole wherein I was first introduced to <b>The Odin Project</b> (TOP).</p>
        <div class="container2">
            <img id="TOP-logo" src="TOP_logo.png" width="200">
            <p>TOP is a free full-stack web development course, and is constantly being updated by a supportive community of writers and coders - many of whom are former learners.
                I thought the program was incredible, and over the course of several months I completed TOP's Foundations Curriculum, which introduced me to:</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML Best Practices</li>
            <li>CSS Concepts like the Box Model, CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts</li>
            <li>JavaScript Fundamentals</li>
            <li>DOM Manipulation & Events</li>
            <li>Command Line and Git Basics</li>
            <li>How to write clean, concise, and accessible code</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
            <p>Beyond these skills, TOP taught me how to focus my creative energy into programming - something that I would have laughed at in February, 2020.
                And yet, despite the learning curve, I quickly realized how rewarding this pasttime could be. At this point, the pandemic had forced me into a part-time position and I could feel that my art career was beginning to stagnate. 
                Although I was still enjoying my role as an arts-facilitator I quickly realized that the most exciting part of my day was coming home after a 5 hour shift and working through TOP's self-directed lessons and assigments.
            </p>
            <p>I found that I liked the way programming forced me to break problems down into manageable blocks. I liked that every (frustrating) issue had a solution - as long as I knew what question to ask.
                And I <b>loved</b> how I could apply my problem-solving brain to any challenge thrown at me. I was starting to realize that programming problems required creative solutions.
            </p>

            <p>Though I still work in arts & culture, I've begun to explore my interest in responsive design and accessible user-experiences. To hone these skills, I am planning to study:</p>

                    <h2>Rock, Paper, Scissors Game</h2>
                    <p>This project was completed as part of TOP's introductory module on Javascript functions, and was initally designed to work solely in the console. 
                        It required a solid understnding of HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Completed in January, 2021, this was my first project made with JavaScript.

                    <p>My Calculator App was the final project of TOP's Foundation Curriculum. Created using JavaScript, basic DOM manipulation, and HTML/CSS, the
                        final design was loosely inspired by the <i>Glassmorphism</i> trends from 2020.
